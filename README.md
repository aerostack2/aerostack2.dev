# aerostack2.dev

The website and documentation of [Aerostack2](https://github.com/aerostack2/aerostack2), an open
source framework for developing multi-robot aerial systems, built on ROS 2.

It's a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app built with [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.dev), deployed on
Vercel.

## Running it

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `bun dev` | Starts the dev server |
| `bun run build` | Builds the site for production |
| `bun start` | Serves the production build |
| `bun run types:check` | Checks the types |
| `bun run lint` | Lints and checks formatting with Biome |
| `bun run changelog` | Writes `CHANGELOG.md` from the commit history with git-cliff |

## Commits

Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org), checked by
commitlint. `bun install` sets up the git hooks with lefthook: Biome fixes the staged files before
each commit and commitlint checks the message. CI runs the lint, the type check, the build and
commitlint on every push to `main` and every pull request.

## Environment

Both variables are optional locally. Put them in `.env.local`, which git ignores.

| Variable | What it's for |
| --- | --- |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | The star and fork counts and the contributors, which take about fifty requests to the GitHub API. Without a token GitHub rate-limits them. `GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)` works |
| `SERPAPI_API_KEY` | The citation count and the list of citing papers, from Google Scholar through [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com). Without it the count falls back to the last known one and the list links to Google Scholar |

GitHub data refreshes once a day and citations once a month, in production and in dev.

## Layout

| Path | What's there |
| --- | --- |
| `content/docs` | The documentation pages, in MDX |
| `src/app/(home)` | The home page |
| `src/app/docs` | The documentation layout and pages |
| `src/components` | Components, including the ones the MDX pages use, registered in `mdx.tsx` |
| `src/lib` | The content source, shared settings and the GitHub and citation data |
| `public` | Images and other static files |
